MOULINATOR rules

The MOULINATOR puts two players against each other on a board made up of four concentric squares connected at the center of their four sides by perpendicular lines. 
The game is played on the 24 points of the board (the intersections and vertices of the squares).
Each player has 9 pieces.

Flow of the game :
Each player in turn can place a piece on one of the points on the board.
If a player aligns 3 pieces along a line, he creates what's known as a mill, enabling him to remove an opponent's piece from the game that doesn't belong to a mill.
Once the players have placed all their pieces, they move on to the movement phase.
The movement phase consists of moving one of your pieces to one of it's adjacent points. 
Similarly, if this move creates a mill, the player can remove an opponent's piece from the game that does not belong to a mill.

Game goal:
To remove the opponent's pieces until he has only two to win the game.
